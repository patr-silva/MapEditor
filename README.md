<h2 id="about">About the project</h2>

MapEditor features a grid and a movable cursor, enabling users to navigate and paint individual cells. 
By pressing the space bar, users can fill in cells, and their creations can be saved to a text file. 

<h2 id="goals">Goals and objectives</h2>

This project served as a practical exercise to solidify my understanding of core Java concepts, including file I/O operations. 

The editor implements a grid-based data structure for efficient cell management and leverages the SimpleGraphicsGFX library to create and style all visual elements, providing a robust and customizable graphical interface.
